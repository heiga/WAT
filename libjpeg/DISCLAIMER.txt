Files have been modified from those available from
the Independant JPEG Group ( http://www.ijg.org/ )
and are derived from version 9.0b of the open source
release.

I claim ownership to only one of the files in the 
enclosed folder, jaltfixes.c

It proved nescessary to create this file to facilitate the 
porting of this library to the DE0 Nano FPGA system. Some 
files in the library were modified to include the needed
changes in jaltfixes.c
