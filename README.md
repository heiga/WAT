The Wireless Autonomous Trolley, or WAT, was the computer engineering capstone project of Randy Baron and Phillip Hoang at
the University of Alberta for 2017.

The WAT is a small robot written primarily in C and built on an Altera DE0 Nano FPGA and runs uCOS-II as the RTOS. 
Using a simple wireless interface it accepts commands from the user to seek out coloured markers which it will then drive towards.
It can also use this interface to receive commands like an RC car.

A video demonstration of the project in action can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQrq3w7PapU

More detailed descriptions of the components and overall design can be found in our final report available in this repository.
